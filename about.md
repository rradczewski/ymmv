# Hi, I'm Raimo

I'm a [self-employed Software Crafter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-06-Continuing_my_journey_as_a_Freelance_Software_Crafter %}) from Berlin, Germany. I help companies build a culture suited to grow and empower people and have them enjoy their work. I also write a lot of code (mostly in JavaScript, React, Redux lately), am fond of Domain-Driven Design and an advocate for Test-Driven-Development.

I owe a lot to the communities out there, which is why I'm trying to give something back, by sharing my experience through this blog and by organizing the [SoCraTes Day Berlin](http://www.socratesday.berlin/), the [Global Day of Coderetreat](http://www.coderetreat.org), the [worldwide Software Craftsmanship Slack](http://slack.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) and I'm also helping out at the [Domain-Driven Design Meetup Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Berlin/).

## What I believe

My beliefs haven't really changed since I became a freelancer almost two years ago, so that [announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-02-06-Continuing_my_journey_as_a_Freelance_Software_Crafter.md %}#developing-software) still stands as of today. I'm still fond of testing, will still work on bringing developers and users closer together, shorten every feedback loop that I see and do my best to support people so they enjoy their work.

More than ever though, I believe that great environments foster great teams, that developing is still means to an end and that the best code is the one that's never written.

## What I do

While I'm happy to get involved in all the aspects of a team working together to create software, I am also perfectly fine with constraining myself to a well-outlined role. I'm a proficient programmer, but also an experienced mentor and leader.

### Coaching / Training

Companies usually hire me to bring my sense of agility and my experience with crafting software into their teams. Be it establishing retrospectives and productive daily stand-ups in the teams, listening to people and their concerns or bridging the gap between developers and users - when I see something where I can help and have an impact, I won't hesitate but get to work.

I also give workshops where I create a space for teams to explore e.g. *Pair Programming* as a tool in their agile toolbox. These workshops don't just happen out of the blue, but I'm making sure they're well prepared and revised afterward and fit what the team wants to do and needs. There shall be [no prisoners](https://retromat.org/en/?id=1) in my workshops!

### Programming

The ecosystems I'm most knowledgeable in are JavaScript/Node.JS and Java/JVM-languages. I'm maintaining a few libraries for JavaScript ([`expect-redux`](https://github.com/rradczewski/expect-redux), [`flowtypify`](https://github.com/rradczewski/flowtypify), [`simple-eventstore`](https://github.com/rradczewski/simple-eventstore)) and can coach and train people in both ecosystems.

Further, I've worked with a broad range of development environments throughout my professional career, from *C++/Qt* desktop applications to *custom JavaScript interpreters* embedded into CRM systems; from self-written *event-sourced Scala back-ends* to full-fledged *Spring Java applications* talking to message queues running on mainframes.  
Having this broad experience and understanding of the underlying principles of software engineering enables me to get into new ecosystems very quickly.

My way of working is deeply aligned with the *XP Principles*, so refactoring, testing and continuous integration and deployment are a *necessity* for me.

## How I like to work

I'm very fond of a professional relationship with my clients. Mutual trust and openness are crucial  aspects of a business relationship for me. I will ask you to establish me as part of the team from day one and to expect me to challenge and change aspects of your company where I see the potential for improvements.

If you're interested in working with me, please send me a mail at [hello@craftswerk.io](mailto:hello@craftswerk.io). I prefer talking to the people I'd work with, so I'd kindly ask external recruiters to not contact me.

# The name of this blog, Your mileage may vary...

...means all of my experiences and observations happen in a particular context, in a setting with a couple of individuals and with specific methods I'm trying out.
I'm happy if my articles help or inspire you and I'm very interested in your feedback (see below). At the end of the day, I'm describing my [biased](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18?gi=4d491e9aedc9#.2n3okjow7), privileged experiences in all the companies I've worked for, or at least what I think I saw and interpreted. If I'm totally off, please tell me.

This is also why I'm doing it in the open. My [Drafts](https://github.com/rradczewski/ymmv/tree/master/_drafts) are open for you to see, as there are [Issues](https://github.com/rradczewski/ymmv/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) where you can leave me feedback. If you prefer a direct way, try [Mail](mailto:hello@craftswerk.io).
