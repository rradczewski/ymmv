# Hi, I'm Raimo

I'm a [self-employed Software Crafter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-06-Continuing_my_journey_as_a_Freelance_Software_Crafter %}) from Berlin, Germany. I help companies build a culture suited to grow and empower people and have them enjoy their work. I also write a lot of code (mostly in JavaScript, React, Redux lately), am fond of Domain-Driven Design and an advocate for Test-Driven-Development.

I owe a lot to the communities out there, which is why I'm trying to give something back, by sharing my experience through this blog and by organizing the [SoCraTes Day Berlin](http://www.socratesday.berlin/), the [Global Day of Coderetreat](http://www.coderetreat.org), the [worldwide Software Craftsmanship Slack](http://slack.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) and I'm also helping out at the [Domain-Driven Design Meetup Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Berlin/).

## What I do

My convictions haven't really changed since I became a freelancer almost two years ago, so that [announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-02-06-Continuing_my_journey_as_a_Freelance_Software_Crafter.md %}#developing-software) still stands as of today. I'm still fond of testing, will still work on bringing developers and users closer together, shorten every feedback loop that I see and do my best to support people so they enjoy their work.

More than ever though, I believe that great environments foster great teams, that developing is still means to an end and that the best code is the one that's never written.

## How I like to work

I'm very fond of a professional relationship with my clients. Mutual trust and openness are crucial  aspects of a business relationship for me. I will ask you to establish me as part of the team from day one and to expect me to challenge and change aspects of your company where I see potential for improvements.

If you're interested in working with me, please send me a mail at [hello@craftswerk.io](mailto:hello@craftswerk.io). I prefer talking to the people I'd work with, so I'd kindly ask external recruiters to not contact me.

# The name of this blog, Your mileage may vary...

...means all of my experiences and observations happen in a particular context, in a setting with a couple of individuals and with specific methods I'm trying out.
I'm happy if my articles help or inspire you and I'm very interested in your feedback (see below). At the end of the day, I'm describing my [biased](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18?gi=4d491e9aedc9#.2n3okjow7), privileged experiences in all the companies I've worked for, or at least what I think I saw and interpreted. If I'm totally off, please tell me.

This is also why I'm doing it in the open. My [Drafts](https://github.com/rradczewski/ymmv/tree/master/_drafts) are open for you to see, as there are [Issues](https://github.com/rradczewski/ymmv/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) where you can leave me feedback. If you prefer a direct way, try [Mail](mailto:hello@craftswerk.io).
