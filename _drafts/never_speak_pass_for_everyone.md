title: "From the Toolbox: Never speak \"pass\" for everyone"

Here's an easy one: You're asking around whether anyone has any questions, somebody answers "no" and you - caught in the moment - move on. Or you're the one not having any questions and suddenly, somebody might not get their answers today because of you.

### Context

This one really plays out in situations where a (self-appointed) leader speaks for the group, be it in workshops or during meetings. It might be yourself who wants to rush through a meeting, or it's a particularly dominant participant in a meeting. The rest of the people might look disengaged or even puzzled. This one can be more subtle with Q&A sessions where people might be too shy to speak up.

You'll find a more subtle version of this situation whenever you find yourself assuming the knowledge of other people in the room, especially when you believe them to be on the exact same page as you are.

### Reasoning

A workshop is there for people to learn, a meeting is there to get everyone on the same page, move forward decisions and to hear different opinions. If somebody speaks for the group (even if that very person is you), you're running at risk to miss one of the goals outlined above.

Oftentimes, we make assumptions about the experience of others, oftentimes aligning those assumptions with our own experience. If you end up dominating a meeting, and yeah, [that might be a systemic issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/women-sexism-work-huffington-kamala-harris.html) (or [two](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Splaining)), it's up to you to hold back and give space to others.

### Pattern

Never let someone speak "pass" for the rest of a group. Combined with [*Count To 10 Before Moving On*]("_drafts/count_to_10_before_moving_on.md"), this can be a powerful tool to hear more than just the dominating opinions. If tensions are high or you're running out of time, you can always invite people to talk to you in private after the meeting.

> Anyone got any questions left unanswered?  
> 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...0  
> Alright. In case you think of something afterwards, feel free to catch me and I'll make sure to pass the answer on to the group.

This gives people a way to answer their questions in a less exposing environment. If you notice this happens a lot, it might be a good idea to establish more structure for the workshop and to do a proper framing in order to make it safer for people to speak up and encourage them to do so.
