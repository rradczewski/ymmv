The quest of finding the common denominator of dietary requirements often times isn't one to win. Before you resort to Pizza though, consider for a moment that you're not hosting a workshop in culinary delight, but would rather avoid food coma so you can resume quickly after lunch. Here's how I give up lunch orders, with more vegan meals the fewer vegans are present.

<TODO>
NEVER, EVER, GO FOR PIZZA.

TL;DR: Vegan food is always best, but if you need to make further amends, try this

# The inverse law of vegan food

*Venn Diagram depicting dietary requirements*

*Pizza cut into slices showing meat, veggie and vegan slices in proportions to the participants requirements*

*Pizza cut into slices anti-proportional to the participants requirements*

If someone is on a meat-based diet, it is, as the name implies, a dietary requirement, so the same logic applies.

# Sorting the buffet

Meat first, behind that veggie, behind that vegan. Make it easier for someone who eats everything to grab the one thing most people with dietary requirements can't eat.

# Allergies

I'm fairly disappointed about the fact that providing extensive information about allergens doesn't seem to be self-evident for most caterers. Lessons learned (too often), by now I'm always double-checking all the ingredients and make sure the caterer provides signs to put up next to the meals listing the ingredients.

I'm working on an app, [alergio.io](alegio.io), to make my life with severe allergies easier.
