title: "Facilitating large retrospectives"
---
Sometimes the stars just won't align and I have to prepare a retrospective that is set up for disaster: Way too many people who need to be there, way too little time to go through the things everyone will bring to the table. I'll try to make ends meet nonetheless, by managing expectations, pushing for small actionable items and most importantly, by asking the attendees for help. Read on about how the most constrained retrospectives I ran still had an impact and yielded actionable results.

<TODO>
## Discuss the constraints

### Too little time

### Too many people

## Discuss the goal

## Ask for help

### anti pattern: people taking too much space

### anti pattern: people talking over another 

## Insist on the timebox

### mechanisms to postpone topics

### self-governance mechanisms (can fail)

## Push for commitments

### reinforce the reasons for doing retrospectives 

-> Put them on the board

</TODO>
