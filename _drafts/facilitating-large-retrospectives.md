title: "Facilitating large retrospectives"
---
Sometimes the stars just won't align and I have to prepare a retrospective that is set up for disaster: Way too many people who need to be there, way too little time to go through the things everyone will bring to the table. I'll try to make ends meet nonetheless, by managing expectations, pushing for small actionable items and most importantly, by asking the attendees for help. Read on about how the most constrained retrospectives I ran still yielded acceptable results.

<TODO>
## Discuss the constraints

## Discuss the goal

## Ask for help

## Insist on the timebox

## Push for commitments

-> Put them on the board
