title: "Why? Pair-Programming Interviews"
excerpt: I recently been tasked to interview a candidate for one of my clients. The candidate could choose from either coming to my client for some Pair Programming, or they could've done a Coding Exercise. I'm happy they chose the former, because it gave me the opportunity to reason about this ritual in particular

_In [this ongoing series](/) I explore why we have specific rituals and from there try to reason how they should be implemented so they live up to their original idea._

I recently been tasked to interview a candidate for one of my clients. The candidate could choose from either coming to my client for some *Pair Programming*, or they could've done a *Coding Exercise*.
I'm happy they chose the former, because it gave me the opportunity to reason about this *ritual* in particular.

## The rationale

## An Example

## The context I tried it

- Small company
- Not-(considering-my-own-biased-ladder)-senior candidates

## The disclaimer

- YMMV
> pair programming by no means makes for an exhaustive hiring proces

## The invitation

I of course remember how nervous I've been at every interview, checking the location of the office and the scheduled time every other minute as the interview came closer.

> Hi _$NAME_,
>
> nice to meet you! I'm the freelancer currently developing the frontend at _$COMPANY_ (find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rradczewski)! ðŸ˜„) and I'm very much looking forward to pairing with you next Tuesday.
>
> If you want, feel free to bring **your own laptop with the dev setup you are comfortable with**.  
> I will have my laptop (Atom, Chrome on top of Gnome on Linux on a Dell) with me as well.
>  
> The codebase is basically a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) app with [react-router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/). Right now, I'm working on filtering the search results and presenting them to the user. I imagine we could pair on getting a specific filter to work (e.g. filtering by price), but I'm open to exploring other tasks as well.
>
> We will have water and coffee provided by the facilities at the office. Our office is on the 4th floor right next to the bathrooms in the lobby.
> I will send you a calendar invitation with the address and a description of how to get to our office.
>  
> Should you have any trouble finding the office, **feel free to give me a call via +491XXXXXXXXX**.  
> Until then, if you have any other questions, feel free to send me a mail :)
>
> Looking forward to meeting you!

Suggestion by Ruben: "I bring my own laptop, with this setup, I will happily show you how it works. If you have, you can also ging your own, but it's no necessity'

## The pairing

- Working on a production code base
  - Legal ramifications
    > I don't care about that too much  
    > Worst case, you throw away a few hours of pair programming and rewrite everything from scratch  
    > If legal steps in on this, either ask the candidate to delete the result (might leave them dissatisfied) or make them sign the simplest form you can come up with to cover against this...  


- Managing expectations about what we should achieve
- Pair Programm on the take home exercise? 
- Do not Pair-Programm with a candidate if you're not coding on the project in your day-to-day
- Goal:
  - Find out how the candidate works with problems
  - See how chemistry works out
  - See if they are open to a conversation
- Not Goals:
  - Culture Fit (unless you really want to, which I discourage you to want)
  - Grilling someone
  - Creating an artificial and awfully inaccurate performance measure of that persons skill
- Things to cover:
  - Interactions
  - Keyboard engagement
  - Knowing the answer to a problem (letting people make errors, crucial to every learning process)
  - Exploring a problem space (sorting?)

## The retrospective
