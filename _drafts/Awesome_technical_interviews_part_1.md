## Preface











## Further Reading








## The rationale

## An Example

## The context I tried it

- Small company
- Not-(considering-my-own-biased-ladder)-senior candidates

## The disclaimer

- YMMV
> pair programming by no means makes for an exhaustive hiring proces

## The invitation

I of course remember how nervous I've been at every interview, checking the location of the office and the scheduled time every other minute as the interview came closer.

<blockquote class="letter" markdown="1">
 Hi _$NAME_,

 nice to meet you! I'm the freelancer currently developing the frontend at _$COMPANY_ (find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rradczewski)! ðŸ˜„) and I'm very much looking forward to pairing with you next Tuesday.

 If you want, feel free to bring **your own laptop with the dev setup you are comfortable with**.  
 I will have my laptop (Atom, Chrome on top of Gnome on Linux on a Dell) with me as well.

 The codebase is basically a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) app with [react-router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/). Right now, I'm working on filtering the search results and presenting them to the user. I imagine we could pair on getting a specific filter to work (e.g. filtering by price), but I'm open to exploring other tasks as well.

 We will have water and coffee provided by the facilities at the office. Our office is on the 4th floor right next to the bathrooms in the lobby.
 I will send you a calendar invitation with the address and a description of how to get to our office.

 Should you have any trouble finding the office, **feel free to give me a call via +491XXXXXXXXX**.  
 Until then, if you have any other questions, feel free to send me a mail :)

 Looking forward to meeting you!
