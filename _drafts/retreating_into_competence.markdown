I had a great time as a first-timer at the [Agile Coach Camp Germany](http://agilecoachcamp.de/), but sometimes, learning new things can get very overwhelming.
After gaining confidence in one subject, really diving into another one usually turns out to be a lesson in humility for me. As I'm learning the In's and Out's of agile coaching, I'm finding myself getting back into building side-projects, just in order to _Retreat Into Competence_.

## Immersing myself in an Agile Coaching conference

The Agile Coach Camp is an annual unconference in a hotel in R√ºckersbach in Bavaria. The first [SoCraTes conference](https://socrates-conference.de) took place in R√ºckersbach years ago, so it's an interesting mix of me discovering the origins of a community I'm very engaged with, all while joining a community I had less connection with before. A lot of topics where familiar but vastly more intense, with a lot of knowledge I could tap into.

*I invite you to check out the market place for [Saturday](https://twitter.com/rradczewski/status/878528171406237696) and [Sunday](https://twitter.com/rradczewski/status/878886460971208704) so you get an idea how interesting and diverse in topics the unconference was.*

I spent my days understanding *Where Everybody Is At* with [@BertholdB](https://twitter.com/bertholdb) , [@MarianneRady](https://twitter.com/MarianneRady) shared her ways of [dealing with her inner critic](https://twitter.com/rradczewski/status/878611376033419264), Together with [@ArminSchubert](https://twitter.com/ArminSchubert), we brainstormed ways to challenge a very mature team of craftspeople. I hosted my own session on *Evolving a Team at Startup-Speed*, sharing my insights and explaining the challenges I faced back when my clients team size doubled every month.

At 10pm on Saturday evening, I felt exhausted. A lot of new things to process, yet not much energy to do so. This is when I brought my notebook from my room, sat down outside and started coding. The task was quite simple, having implemented similar algorithms plenty of times in the past: I wanted to have an algorithm that could tell me the most significant *Neuland Markers* used in a photo of a sketchnote.

After an hour, this \[[source](https://gist.github.com/rradczewski/a6e2ba725b7fc5f0f3549e30d92c4a2d)\] is what I had, plus some React code for the UI:

This is to me what David H. Hoover and Adewale Oshineye described as [Retreating Into Competence](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#solution_id8) in their most excellent book *Apprenticeship Patterns*, (free to read on [Chimera](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html)): As someone getting into a new subject, be it a new programming language, a framework, or, like with me, *Agile Coaching*, there are patterns like [Exposing Your Ignorance](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#expose_your_ignorance) or [Being The Worst](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch04.html#be_the_worst) that helped me plenty of times getting into the mood of starting from scratch. But every once in a while, all those new insights can be overwhelming.

## I'm more confident in coding than I am in coaching

Since becoming a [Frelancer earlier this year]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-06-Continuing_my_journey_as_a_Freelance_Software_Craftsman %}) I've been working with clients in a very interesting mode: Almost half of my time is spent working on frontend projects, the other half is spent improving their rituals and culture.

Now there is an interesting thing I found out about me in this time: I'm very much enjoying doing both coding and coaching, yet the latter is much more challenging and exhausting for me. After spending days on preparing retrospectives and revisiting the rituals we implemented, I noticed that I'm recharging through coding.  
It can be a refactoring on production code, or something like this little clustering algorithm. I've gone so far as to implement the same business logic of a side project **three times** now - each time changing perspectives, starting with something different, going a different direction.

## From time to time, do what you're good at

Going back since the my first days at vaamo, *Retreating into Competence* has to be the single most helpful of all *Apprenticeship Patterns* to me.
It's been part of my pattern toolkit of learning something new ever since and I'm convinced it can be useful to others as well.
