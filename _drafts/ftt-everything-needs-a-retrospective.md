I spend most of my time at work collaborating with people. Everything, from mentoring developers over creating a enjoyable engineering culture to building great products involves at least two individuals. To understand what works and what does not and to continuously improve our way of working, I strive to add retrospectives to every collaboration, be it a meeting or a pairing session.

### Context

You're in a meeting, a mentoring or a pairing session, or really any situation where collaboration between individuals happens. You want to understand how everyone present perceived the meeting, share your own observations and first and foremost you want to improve every following collaboration.

In situations where you are mentoring, you want to understand how your methods are received and if you can do anything to improve the learning experience for your mentee.

### Reasoning

Establishing a feedback channel like retrospectives gives everyone the option to voice their feelings towards a meeting. Just as unheard frustrations can turn into conflicts, positive feedback easily falls under the table as people rush out of a meeting - and let's not start with what misunderstandings can cause.

### Pattern

Plan, announce and account for a short 5-minute retrospective at the end of any of your collaborations.

If you want to gather some quick feedback, asking every attendee to answer a single question will already provide you with valuable insights.

> Do you feel like this was time well spent? If not, what would you change?  
> Do you feel that you leave this meeting well informed?
> Do you feel like all your questions where properly addressed?

If you got some more time and Post-It's, ask everyone to take a minute and write down their observations, feelings and of course their kudos, e.g. with the [4 Ls method](https://retromat.org/en/?id=78).

> What I Loved  
> What I Learned  
> What I Lacked  
> What I Longed For  

Let them quickly share their insights afterwards. Make sure to not stretch the time-box though!

In a mentoring situation, ask questions that give you feedback on how your mentoring was perceived - it's about the mentee's learning experience after all!

> Is there anything we can change next time to improve this for you?  
> How was the pace? Did we take enough breaks?
