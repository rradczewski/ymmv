excerpt: "At more than one occasion this year, I ran a workshop that combined two of my dearest topics: Coffee and Kanban. I got consultants, developers, testers and product managers to try to optimize the flow of coffee. The most interesting insight for me? You should make people feel comfortable to stop the line."

## What is Coffee Kanban?

Coffee Kanban is a workshop I had the idea for when preparing for [SoCraTes 2018](https://www.socrates-conference.de/). Just like every year, I packed all my coffee equipment and some beans from my local roasteries to share with the other attendees and so did they. Between us, we had about 5 kilogram of delicious third wave coffee and every conceivable method of brewing it.

In the last years, a lot of attendees of SoCraTes conference were eager to learn how to make good coffee but it was difficult for them to find someone to show them as we'd mostly just rush from session to session and stopped only to quickly make ourselves a coffee.

Add to that the fact that I'm very fond of Kanban and its origins in manufacturing and with that, the idea was born to create a coffee manufacturing line utilizing Kanban principles.

## Designing the factory floor

The one thing I find most challenging about mentoring is teaching something that - by then - comes completely natural to me. Coffee making is one of these - every morning, every move I do is spot on:  
From first weighting the water so it can heat while I weight and grind the beans and prepare the AeroPress, to slightly tilting the stamp after pouring the water to create suction that will keep the water inside the AeroPress - each of these moves happens subconsciously. Explicating each of those steps didn't come that easy to me, something I found very peculiar.

What I ended up where 13 distinct steps[^1] that I had index cards designed for. These would serve as the **Stations** of the factory floor, with people being assigned to at most one station at any time.

## Insights from the workshops at Leanovate, SoCraTes 2018 & ProductCamp Berlin 2018

I owe a big **Thank You** to [Leanovate](https://www.leanovate.de/) for letting me crash yet another one of their company-internal LeanovateDays to test-drive this workshop and for their invaluable feedback. We ended up producing a mess in their kitchen after lunch, but the workshop and the retrospective provided me with so much things to revisit that it really helped flesh out the workshop right in time for the big conference.

For SoCraTes 2018, I iterated over the station setup, aggregating them so a person is assigned to a station, such as grinding or brewing, with around 4 distinct but related tasks.
I further designated the cups to be the "kanban container", the item that flows through the system and added an order-sticker on it so we could keep track of the order and its metrics as it passes from station to station.

We set up the factory floor where we always put our coffee gear, right in the hallway where people could order a coffee before they go to another session. The session on Friday was so interesting that we ran another one on Saturday and we made sure to measure both **Cycle Time** (the time it takes to brew a coffee, from grabbing the order cup) and **Lead Time** (the time it takes from ordering to receiving the coffee).

Let me spill the beans to you right away: Putting it mildly, we were rather slow in the first session. Average **Lead Time** was about 18 minutes, even though we **Cycle Time** floated around at about 9 minutes. One poor soul had to wait 40 minutes for their coffee ðŸ˜±.

But the first session was purely about experimenting with the format, so we didn't take time to think and reflect about the intricacies of the process. For example, we picked orders at random, not by any measure of priority. We never made the conscious decision between prioritizing already late orders or dropping late orders to be quick with the orders still coming in. I was trying to assign people to the stations as soon as I saw a station running at full capacity, but I couldn't keep up and it felt a bit like my presence ruined the notion of self-organization - there was no moment where one of the workers "**Stopped The Line**" in order to make the others aware of an issue they had.

### Insight #1: Optimizing for speed risks everything

The room was buzzing with noise and hectic movements, people rushing to pick up an order but not paying attention to the system load or issues other stations had. There was one particular issue that stuck with me as it mirrored back a typical organizational dysfunction as deadlines approach and everyone puts their blinders on and stops looking left and right:

At one point, the "customers" had to wash used cups in order to put in an order. More often than not, the cups - our designated kanban container - would still be wet inside. The **Grind**-station did as they were told, grinding the beans directly into the cup. Once they were done, they placed the cup in their output queue and moved on to the next order.  
As the **Preparing**-station picked up the order, their next step would've been to pour the ground coffee from the cup into the AeroPress, but they struggled with the coffee sticking to the wet cup. They helped themselves with a spoon, but they lacked the space to give feedback to the **Grind**-station. Purely by chance, I became aware of the issue and made sure to mention it to the people at the **Grind**-station, who immediately started wiping the cups dry before grinding the coffee into them.

The next day, the second session went much better. We managed to get the average **Lead Time** down to 11 minutes and **Cycle Time** was stable at 8 minutes. No one waited more than 16 minutes for their coffee ðŸ’ª.

### Insight #2: Stop the line, either on-demand or regularly

### Insight #3: Encourage self-organization, make conscious decisions
