Just as much as [everything needs a retrospective]({% link _posts/2018-10-17-ftt-everything-needs-a-retrospective.md %}), your mentoring sessions and meetings will leave people more satisfied and happier if you make sure to check-in with them first. Learn about where people are coming from and how they like to learn first and you'll find that it benefits everyone in the room.

I've been running a rather unconventional session at the conferences I went to: A session that teaches kanban principles to the participants and observers through building an assembly line to make coffee - The **Coffee Kanban Session**.

Between those sessions, there were plenty of people who never used an [AeroPress](https://www.aeropress.com/product/aeropress/) before, so I went ahead and showed it to them, but not without asking them about how they'd like to learn it first, just like I do whenever I'm mentoring someone in a workplace setting.

## Context

You're in a situation where your mission is to share knowledge or facilitate decisions. You want to make the best out of the time ahead of the group and make sure that you understand where people come from, what their preferred style of learning and of course their personal boundaries are.

## Reasoning

As a mentor or leader, you need to understand your colleagues as individuals with their own aspirations and experience. Not taking the time to learn about them will leave you imposing your way of teaching onto them. In the long run, this would take away a valuable feedback channel for you, not just because you don't evolve yourself, but also because your authority prevents someone from speaking their mind if something doesn't go as they would appreciate.

## Pattern

Before you start working with someone - in particular if it's the first time, sit down with them and do a check-in. Ask them how they'd like to work and make sure to share your opinion. Be careful with your authority, though, so leave some room for the other person to share theirs.

In case you're about to start a Pair Programming session for example, make sure that both of you are aware of the different modes and choose one together!

> We could do "Ping-Pong" pairing, where we switch every time we have a red test, or we could switch between **Driving** and **Navigating** every 15 minutes. What would you like to do?

In other situations, I noticed that a lot of the times I do a check-in with someone, their answer will fall into one of the following categories

### **"Let's take some time upfront to discuss"**   
*☕ This means explaining everything about making a coffee with an AeroPress first.*

I like this one because I myself appreciate knowing what's about to happen. Preparing a meeting in this way will create more alignment between everyone and makes expectations transparent.

### **"Let's just learn as we go"**  
*☕ Get the filter paper, let's make a mess and have some coffee!*

This is how the meeting would probably happen without a check-in. I understand this as a sign that the other person is confident to raise questions while we're working. I'll make sure to do a retrospective ([Everything Needs A Retrospective]({% link _posts/2018-10-17-ftt-everything-needs-a-retrospective.md %}) so we can revisit our modus operandi.

### **"You do it and I'll ask questions"**  
*☕ Forget your muscle memory of making hundreds of coffees - explain as you go!*

In my experience, this response can be an indicator for the person being a bit intimidated by the task or the overall situation. In a mentoring situation, I might inquire about their personal goal for the meeting. In any case, complying with this request means taking things slow and provide enough space for questions and for revisiting fundamentals.



Whatever they reply, make sure to keep it in mind and try to accommodate their wishes - it will make for a much better session. Also remember that this is a two-way-street! If you have a preferred way of going about things, it's best if it's shared with everyone else!
