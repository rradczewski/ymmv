title: "How-To: SoCraTes Day Berlin"
---
With the registration open and the waiting lists bursting at their seams, SoCraTes Day Berlin is well on it's way for its third edition. I'm glad people are returning and are even inviting their friends, because that means I'm doing something right. What that is? Well, let's find out...

This post will be a huge brain-dump I imagine and I hope it serves both people who want to join us at SoCraTes Day Berlin but would like to know what they're getting into first, and those who'd like to create something like SoCraTes Day Berlin themselves.

## Organizer, singular.

SoCraTes Day Berlin is my brain-child and besides Susi from Leanovate, who is working tirelessly on making us feel welcome at their office, I'm the only person running the show. If you talked to me about organizing communities before, you most likely are about to call me out on my hypocrisy: I usually stress that you should never organize anything alone.

As with every rule, there's a catch to it: If you've organized events like this dozens of times, you grow an understanding of their critical path, the base-line of things that have to be taken care of for the event to happen. With Susi taking care of the hosting bits, I feel like I'm in good control of the workload around SoCraTes Day Berlin.

The reason I organize it myself though is that I want to be able to shape it in any way I'd like before inviting others to contribute. An example for this is Friday. At this point, not even I know exactly what's going to happen on Friday. What I know is that there's a room, we'll get food there and about 30 of the attendees of the Saturday event. From here, I can focus all my energy on reaching out to people I always wanted to hear talk. 

## Attendees, plural.

## Food

## Content

## Framing

## Schedule

## Diversity
