title: "Why? Pair-Programming Interviews"
categories: why
---

_In [this ongoing series](/) I explore why we have specific rituals and from there try to reason how they should be implemented so they live up to their original idea._

I recently been tasked to interview a candidate for one of my clients. The candidate could choose from either coming to my client for some *Pair Programming*, or they could've done a *Coding Exercise*.
I'm happy they chose the former, because it gave me the opportunity to reason about this *ritual* in particular.

## The rationale

## The invitation

I of course remember how nervous I've been at every interview, checking the location of the office and the scheduled time every other minute as the interview came closer.

> Hi _$NAME_,

> nice to meet you! I'm the freelancer currently developing the frontend at _$COMPANY_ (find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rradczewski)! ðŸ˜„) and I'm very much looking forward to pairing with you next Tuesday.

> If you want, feel free to bring **your own laptop with the dev setup you are comfortable with**.  
> I will have my laptop (Atom, Chrome on top of Gnome on Linux on a Dell) with me as well.

> The codebase is basically a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) app with [react-router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/). Right now, I'm working on filtering the search results and presenting them to the user. I imagine we could pair on getting a specific filter to work (e.g. filtering by price), but I'm open to exploring other tasks as well.

> We will have water and coffee provided by the facilities at the office. Our office is on the 4th floor right next to the bathrooms in the lobby.
> I will send you a calendar invitation with the address and a description of how to get to our office.
