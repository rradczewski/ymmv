title: "From the Toolbox: Never ask \"Who doesn't know $YYY\""
---
If you really want to pick up people from where they are, never ask them to expose their ignorance in public. You won't get an honest answer, for understandable reasons.

### Context

You're giving a talk, are moderating a workshop or meeting, or maybe you are just pairing with another person. You want to make sure they understand where you are about to be going. A natural impulse would be to ask "Who doesn't know about *$YYY*?" or "Do you know about *$YYY*?".

### Reasoning

While I personally love [*Exposing My Ignorance*](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/ch02s05.html), I also understand that this requires the psychological safety to do so. Chances are, especially in a group of people with different levels of [social capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital), someone exposing their ignorance might (rightfully) fear of doing so because they'd risk their reputation and at worst would only be seen as [confirming stereotypes](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Condescension). A very common and relatable example are e.g. junior developers or people who are still on probation.

Another aspect to consider is that, especially with complex topics (e.g. architectures, paradigms), people might have lots of experience in the field [but won't consider themselves knowledgeable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). And despite all your confidence and authority as the person speaking to the group, there still might be another perspective coming from someone in the audience you'd be missing out on if you're not sharing what you know first.

### Pattern

So instead of asking people to expose their ignorance, ask whether they'd like to hear a quick primer on your understanding of topic *$YYY*.

> Would you like to hear a quick primer on topic $YYY?  
> Is it okay if I start with a primer on topic $YYY?

Especially the latter offers an easy way of signaling interest without exposing oneself.

If you want to be really inviting and feel comfortable doing so, you can also expose your ignorance and thus use your authority to establish a fail-safe environment:

> I'll try to give you a quick overview of what I understood, if that is alright. Please feel free to add your own thoughts at the end so we're on the same page.

Make sure to account for the time it takes to get on the same page when you call for a meeting or a workshop. I found using proper timeboxes and an agenda to structure a meeting is much more productive than rushing through the basics and loosing people in the process.
