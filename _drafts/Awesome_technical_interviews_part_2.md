## The pairing

- Working on a production code base
  - Legal ramifications
    > I don't care about that too much  
    > Worst case, you throw away a few hours of pair programming and rewrite everything from scratch  
    > If legal steps in on this, either ask the candidate to delete the result (might leave them dissatisfied) or make them sign the simplest form you can come up with to cover against this...  


- Managing expectations about what we should achieve
- Pair Programm on the take home exercise?
- Do not Pair-Programm with a candidate if you're not coding on the project in your day-to-day
- Goal:
  - Find out how the candidate works with problems
  - See how chemistry works out
  - See if they are open to a conversation
- Not Goals:
  - Culture Fit (unless you really want to, which I discourage you to want)
  - Grilling someone
  - Creating an artificial and awfully inaccurate performance measure of that persons skill
- Things to cover:
  - Interactions
  - Keyboard engagement
  - Knowing the answer to a problem (letting people make errors, crucial to every learning process)
  - Exploring a problem space (sorting?)
