Think about it - there are only a few occasions in your professional life that are as exceptional and stressful as interviewing for a new job. The power balances lined up against you, the unknown ahead of you. As an interviewer, it is now your task to mitigate all that.

*This is Part #2 of my series on [Awesome Technical Interviews]({% link _drafts/Awesome_technical_interviews_part_0.md %}). Part #1 can be found [here]({% link _drafts/Awesome_technical_interviews_part_1.md %}).*

## Preparations

The invitation is sent out, the interviewee accepted and the interview is still a week or two away; Time to plan the day! That interview will be the most important meeting I'm having that day, so I go and reschedule everything before and after the interview.

I will be the *Navigator*, so I'm making sure I understand the task I picked. In case I chose to use the production code base, I delete the folder and setup everything from scratch. If you chose the same, repeat this until you are sure that it can be done in the matter of a few minutes. If you're unsure, try it on a colleague's machine as well.

Whenever I'm very unsure about the experience of the interviewee, I make sure to make up your mind about which guidance I want to give and how I could change and steer the task to become easier or harder. This is a crucial part of my preparations because it is up to me to make the interview a pleasant and insightful experience.

## Managing expectations

I'll keep reiterating my goal from [Part #1]({% link _drafts/Awesome_technical_interviews_part_1.md %}):

**Minimize surprises for the interviewee and everyone else involved at every point in the hiring process.**

Let's start with my own expectations: I want the interview to go well. I am investing a lot of time in it, the company is paying for it and the goal is that it ultimately results in a new colleague. I want to get to know my new colleague. At this point, my default assumption is that I want to work with the person I'm going to interview with.

The more aware I am of these expectations towards me and the interview itself, the better I will be able to empathize with the interviewee. Just as with the invitation, the way I will soon explain the expectations towards the interviewee to them will help mitigate their nervousness and will allow me to get a better and authentic idea of the person in front of me. As a pleasant side-effect, this will also help me with my nervousness on the day of the interview.

## Good to see you!

On the day of the interview, I unmute my phone so I don't miss a message from the interviewee. Once they arrive, I try to be the first person to greet them. From this point on, I have to be aware of the fact that there will be a power imbalance in my interactions with the interviewee: I will be calling the shots on everything that's going to happen and the interviewee's well-being is in my hand.

Once the two of us settled down, the first important question I ask is:  
*"Are you well? I promise that there is no disadvantage for you if we reschedule this interview because you are not feeling well."*  

And I mean that. Bad luck happens and Moore's Law (*by definition*) strikes on the worst occasions. The interview is one of the most important meetings someone will have during their employment at a company; if their mind is somewhere else or they are feeling sick, I accept that and reschedule the interview.

If everything is well, I proceed with explaining the agenda of the day: We will pair for exactly one hour, then have a short retrospective about the session and finally close down the meeting with a coffee.

## The pairing

In the case that the interviewee brought their own laptop, the next few minutes will be spent waiting for *git*, *npm*, *IntelliJ* or about every tool needed to setup the code base and run the tests, so I take this time to explain the interviewee that the next hour is not about getting things done or finishing the task (**!**), but about seeing how our collaboration works out and how they approach the problem in a pairing setup. There is no need to be mysterious about this - quite the opposite! The more the explicitly you lay out your expectations, the more comfortable the interviewee is going to be with showing their best.

Not everyone is used to pairing, so it's important for me to explain that I'm their partner in this and that I'm looking to have discussions with them, not quiz them on the task. I will answer every question they will have and should I be at a loss, it's completely fine for us to resort to StackOverflow.

Pairing with them also means getting a grasp of their overall skill level: How fast they are with the IDE, how knowledgeable they are in the programming language and its ecosystem, what kind of questions they ask or discussions they start. It's important for me to not be too picky here though. You should have certain expectations towards someone who's applying for a *Senior Developer* role, but an hour is nowhere enough to categorize someone on an engineering ladder, so I tick this box as early as possible and move on.

## My observations

I will closely watch our interactions throughout the pairing session and take notes whenever I deem something to be relevant enough. This can irritate the interviewee, which is why I make sure to warn them about me writing down something every so often. Again, I can be completely transparent with them about why I do this: I need to relay my impression to others at some point later. Writing down notes now prevents me from recalling something from my memory, which gets worse the more time passes and the more I do between the pairing session and writing down my impression.

  - Interactions
  - Keyboard engagement
  - Knowing the answer to a problem (letting people make errors, crucial to every learning process)
  - Exploring a problem space
