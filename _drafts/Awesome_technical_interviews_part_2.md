Think about it - there are only a few occasions in your professional life that are as exceptional and stressful as interviewing for a new job. The power balances lined up against you, the unknown ahead of you. Find out how I'm trying to mitigate that.

## Context

## Setting up everything

## Managing expectations

- Managing expectations about what we should achieve

## The pairing

- Goal:
  - Find out how the candidate works with problems
  - See if they are open to a conversation
- Not Goals:
  - Culture Fit
  - Grilling someone
  - Creating an artificial and awfully inaccurate performance measure of that persons skill

- Things to cover:
  - Interactions
  - Keyboard engagement
  - Knowing the answer to a problem (letting people make errors, crucial to every learning process)
  - Exploring a problem space

## The retrospective

## The result

- Writing down results
- unconscious bias
