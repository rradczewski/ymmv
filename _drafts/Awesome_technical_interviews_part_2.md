Think about it - there are only a few occasions in your professional life that are as exceptional and stressful as interviewing for a new job. The power balances lined up against you, the unknown ahead of you. Find out how I, the interviewer, am trying to mitigate all of that.

## Preparations

You sent out the invitation, the interviewee accepted and the interview is still a week or two away; Time to plan your day! That interview should be the most important meeting you're having that day, so go and reschedule everything before and after the interview.

You'll be the *Navigator*, so make sure you understand the task you picked. In case you want to use your production code base, delete the folder and setup everything from scratch. Repeat that until you are sure that it can be done in the matter of a few minutes. If you're unsure, try it on a colleague's machine as well.

If you are unsure about the experience of the interviewee, you might want to make up your mind about which guidance you want to give and how you could change the task to become easier or harder. This is a crucial part of your preparations because it is up to you to make the interview a pleasant and insightful experience.

## Managing expectations

Remember the goal from [Part #1]():

**Minimize surprises for the interviewee and everyone else involved at every point in the hiring process.**

Let's start with your expectations: You want the interview to go well. You are investing time in it, your company is paying for it and the goal is that it ultimately results in a new colleague. You want to get to know your new colleague. At this point, your default assumption has to be that you want to work with the person you're going to interview with.

<TODO>==================== Drafted until here ====================</TODO>

- Managing their expectations
- Welcoming them at the office
- Explaining what is going to happen
- Ask them if they feel fine or if you should reschedule.



- Managing expectations about what we should achieve

## The pairing

- Goal:
  - Find out how the candidate works with problems
  - See if they are open to a conversation
- Not Goals:
  - Culture Fit
  - Grilling someone
  - Creating an artificial and awfully inaccurate performance measure of that persons skill

- Things to cover:
  - Interactions
  - Keyboard engagement
  - Knowing the answer to a problem (letting people make errors, crucial to every learning process)
  - Exploring a problem space

## The retrospective

## The result

- Writing down results
- unconscious bias
