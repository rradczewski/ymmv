Think about it - there are only a few occasions in your professional life that are as exceptional and stressful as interviewing for a new job. The power balances lined up against you, the unknown ahead of you. As an interviewer, it is now your task to mitigate all that.

## Preparations

The invitation is sent out, the interviewee accepted and the interview is still a week or two away; Time to plan the day! That interview will be the most important meeting I'm having that day, so I go and reschedule everything before and after the interview.

I will be the *Navigator*, so I'm making sure I understand the task I picked. In case I chose to use the production code base, I delete the folder and setup everything from scratch. If you chose the same, repeat this until you are sure that it can be done in the matter of a few minutes. If you're unsure, try it on a colleague's machine as well.

Whenever I'm very unsure about the experience of the interviewee, I make sure to make up your mind about which guidance I want to give and how I could change and steer the task to become easier or harder. This is a crucial part of my preparations because it is up to me to make the interview a pleasant and insightful experience.

## Managing expectations

I'll keep reiterating my goal from [Part #1]({% link _drafts/Awesome_technical_interviews_part_1.md %}):

**Minimize surprises for the interviewee and everyone else involved at every point in the hiring process.**

Let's start with my own expectations: I want the interview to go well. I am investing a lot of time in it, the company is paying for it and the goal is that it ultimately results in a new colleague. I want to get to know my new colleague. At this point, my default assumption is that I want to work with the person I'm going to interview with.

The more aware I am of these expectations towards me and the interview itself, the better I will be able to empathize with the interviewee. Just as with the invitation, the way I will soon explain the expectations towards the interviewee to them will help mitigate their nervousness and will allow me to get a better and authentic idea of the person in front of me. As a pleasant side-effect, this will also help me with my nervousness on the day of the interview.

## Good to see you!

On the day of the interview, I unmute my phone so I don't miss a message from the interviewee. Once they arrive, I try to be the first person to greet them. From this point on, I have to be aware of the fact that there will be a power imbalance in my interactions with the interviewee: I will be calling the shots on everything that's going to happen and the interviewee's well-being is in my hand.

Once the two of us settled down, the first important question I ask is:  
*"Are you well? I promise that there is no disadvantage for you if we reschedule this interview because you are not feeling well."*  

And I mean that. Bad luck happens and Moore's Law (*by definition*) strikes on the worst occasions. The interview is one of the most important meetings someone will have during their employment at a company; if their mind is somewhere else or they are feeling sick, I accept that and reschedule the interview.

## What to pay attention to?




<TODO>==================== Drafted until here ====================</TODO>

- Managing their expectations
- Welcoming them at the office
- Explaining what is going to happen
- Ask them if they feel fine or if you should reschedule.



- Managing expectations about what we should achieve

## The pairing

- Goal:
  - Find out how the candidate works with problems
  - See if they are open to a conversation
- Not Goals:
  - Culture Fit
  - Grilling someone
  - Creating an artificial and awfully inaccurate performance measure of that persons skill

- Things to cover:
  - Interactions
  - Keyboard engagement
  - Knowing the answer to a problem (letting people make errors, crucial to every learning process)
  - Exploring a problem space

## The retrospective

## The result

- Writing down results
- unconscious bias
