Think about it - there are only a few occasions in your professional life that are as exceptional and stressful as interviewing for a new job. The power balances lined up against you, the unknown ahead of you. As an interviewer, it is now your task to mitigate all that.

## Preparations

You sent out the invitation, the interviewee accepted and the interview is still a week or two away; Time to plan your day! That interview should be the most important meeting you're having that day, so go and reschedule everything before and after the interview.

You'll be the *Navigator*, so make sure you understand the task you picked. In case you want to use your production code base, delete the folder and setup everything from scratch. Repeat that until you are sure that it can be done in the matter of a few minutes. If you're unsure, try it on a colleague's machine as well.

If you are unsure about the experience of the interviewee, you might want to make up your mind about which guidance you want to give and how you could change the task to become easier or harder. This is a crucial part of your preparations because it is up to you to make the interview a pleasant and insightful experience.

## Managing expectations

Remember the goal from [Part #1]({% link _drafts/Awesome_technical_interviews_part_1.md %}):

**Minimize surprises for the interviewee and everyone else involved at every point in the hiring process.**

Let's start with your expectations: You want the interview to go well. You are investing time in it, your company is paying for it and the goal is that it ultimately results in a new colleague. You want to get to know your new colleague. At this point, your default assumption has to be that you want to work with the person you're going to interview with.

The more aware you are of these expectations towards you and the interview itself, the better you will be able to empathize with the interviewee. Just as with the invitation, the way you will explain the expectations towards the interviewee to them will help mitigate their nervousness and will allow you to get a better and authentic idea of the person in front of you. As a pleasant side-effect, this will also help you with your nervousness on the day of the interview.

## Good to see you!

On the day of the interview, I unmute my phone so I don't miss a message from the interviewee. Once they arrive, I try to be the first person to greet them. From this point on, be aware of the fact that there will be a power imbalance in your interactions with the interviewee: You are calling the shots on everything and the interviewee's well-being is in your hand.

Once the two of you settled down, the first important question you should ask is:  
*"Are you well? I promise that there is no disadvantage for you if we reschedule this interview because you are not feeling well."*  

And I mean that. Bad luck happens and Moore's Law strikes on the worst occasions. The interview is one of the most important meetings someone will have during their employment at a company; if their mind is somewhere else or they are feeling sick, accept that and reschedule the interview.
