title: "'Why?-Series' on exploring the reasoning behind rituals"
---

Daily stand-ups are **not** status updates, yet we've seen them become one so often.  
Too often, I find myself doing a **ritual** because I've done it at every other company as well.   
And too often, I find a ritual not working in a company because I was ignorant about why the other company implemented in the first place.

This is my approach at challenging this. Starting with this and **The Daily Stand-up** and [Why? Pair Programming Interviews](), I'm trying to take apart my own ideas and reasoning behind a ritual and try to steer it's implementation so it keeps up with its original cause.

## The Daily Stand-up

## Choosing the right rituals

### Context

- Small team(s) with 4-10 people
- Majority should have some experience in agile **and** dysfunctional agile environments
- Ability to establish a culture that continuously strives to improve collaboration models.
