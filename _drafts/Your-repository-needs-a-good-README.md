title: "README for onboarding new hires"

Have a look at your README.md right now. How easy is it to get your project up and running from scratch? What does someone need to know about making changes to the codebase? If your README is not providing definite and up to date answers to these questions, you're making it harder for people to contribute and experiment.

Not satisfied with your current README? There's an easy trick: Next time someone is setting up the project, sit next to them and Pair-Programm that README so it's all the next person will need.

# At a glance: What and how?

A README is the first thing you see when you go on a project repository, be it on github oder gitlab. The first question it should answer is: *Is this what I'm looking for?* 

What is the project good for? Is it the frontend? Is it the backend? Is it a collection of database migration scripts?
