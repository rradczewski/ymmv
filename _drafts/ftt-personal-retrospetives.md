Every year since 2014, I retreat over the christmas holidays and hold a personal retrospective. Over the course of one or two days, I reflect on the past year and make New Year's resolutions[^1], and actually ones that I was pretty successful following through with so far. And even if you only have a couple of hours to retreat, it's still a valuable exercise that I invite you to try for yourself.

My inspiration to do this came from a conversation I must've had at [SoCraTes 2014](https://socrates-conference.de/). A fellow participant <TODO>WHO?</TODO> told us how they're running their yearly retrospective: They write their own apprenticeship diploma, reflecting on their past year from an imaginative mentor-perspective and offering advice for the year to come.

Back then I was less fond of writing, so instead of writing a letter to myself, I covered my couch table in [paper](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80324072/) and started drawing a mind-map. Since then, I improved the format every year to the point that people got curious about the method, which is why I'm sharing it now. For obvious reasons, I won't share the results of my personal retrospectives, though.

# Context

I rarely take enough time to properly reflect on major events throughout the year, let alone appreciate or critically analyze them. Christmas holidays happen to be the time of the year in Germany where the clocks seem to stand still; there are few distractions online, most of my peers are spending all of the holidays traveling or with their families[^2] and most importantly there are next to no social events to attend outside of your family circles. While I fully understand how loneliness can get to people during these days, I found that the retrospective doesn't let it get to me during those days.

While I employ methods I learned from my professional skillset, I don't want the goal of the retrospective to be to *optimize* my life, but to *improve* it. This framing changed a lot about how I look at the methodologies at work as well and I tend to think this is for the better.

# Reasoning

My reason to hold these retrospectives is that I want to look at the past year, and not just my achievements or the good things that happened, but plainly the *amplitudes*, the up's and down's of the year and see where they lead me. From there, I'm carefully considering my wishes for the future to see how I can achieve them.

Holding them for the last few years has helped me focus my efforts on aspects of my life, both private and professional, that seemed untameable.

# Pattern

## Retrospective

### Framing

<TODO>
- Places I've been to (friends, cities, countries)
- People I've been with
- Achievements I made
</TODO>

<TODO>
- I feel ...
- I wish/want ...
</TODO>

## Prospective

<TODO>
- Framing (don't feel bad if you don't make everything, true north goals)
- Tracking/Measureability
- Goals and Stepping Stones (OKRs)
- Revisiting goals throughout the year
</TODO>

[^1]: As you'll see later on, Christmas holidays only coincidentally happen to be a time where I can retreat without distractions. I wouldn't mind doing a personal retrospective throughout the year, but it's much easier to start during a time of few to no distractions and go from there.
[^2]: For the record, I do too, just not the whole time.
