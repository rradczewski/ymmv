Every year since 2014, I retreat over the christmas holidays to have a personal retrospective. Over the course of two days, I reflect on the past year and make New Years resolutions that I'm actually keen on following through. Even if you only have a couple of hours to retreat, it's still a valuable exercise that I invite you to try yourself.

# Context

<TODO>
Reminding one of their achievements/good things throughout the year
</TODO>

# Reasoning

<TODO>
Christmas holidays most of the people I know are busy and preoccupied.
Lonely in the most positive sense
</TODO>

# Pattern

## Retrospective

### Framing

<TODO>
- Places I've been to (friends, cities, countries)
- People I've been with
- Achievements I made
</TODO>

<TODO>
- I feel ...
- I wish/want ...
</TODO>

## Prospective

<TODO>
- Framing (don't feel bad if you don't make everything, true north goals)
- Tracking/Measureability
- Goals and Stepping Stones (OKRs)
- Revisiting goals throughout the year
</TODO>
