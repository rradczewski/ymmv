title: "Too Many Kudos"
---
Kudos cards help you overcome the awkwardness of sharing appreciations. This makes them a really powerful ritual, but you still have to take the time and hand-write the card; something that may slip your mind if you are frequently out of the office.
I recently built a slackbot that prints them in the office for you, but I'm left wondering if this could lead to devaluing the heartfelt appreciation they're supposed to convey.
In order to understand why this could be an issue, we first need to understand why they're so powerful in the first place.

## Why is it awkward anyway?

I guess it's part of the human condition, that we're generally more likely to put someone down when they mess up, than to appreciate them when they stand with us and help us out. And I totally get it, a heartfelt appreciation makes you vulnerable – it's much easier to be cynical and detached.

When a team manages to create a space safe enough for showing this kind of vulnerability though, Kudos cards become an amazing catalyst for team-bonding. It's still a bit awkward, but with a proper ritual and a feigned sense of anonymity (more on that later), they create a space of compassion and empathy.

## The value of a kudos

- Handwritten – pseudo-anonymously
- Honesty – not playing games with kudos, no politics/diplomacy
- "Content is king" – heartfelt appreciation of your person trumps appreciation of trivial actions
- "Someone took the time to write the kudos in the first place"
- "You might have an idea who that is"
- "Writing style, emoji's transport more than a handwriting font could ever do"
- You live with the fact that kudos can be repetitive and boring in order to keep up the ritual of it being appreciation given from one person to another person ~directly

## Another kind of "anonymity"

When developers think about anonymity, we think about the goal being that something can not be associated with you ever.

With kudos cards, anonymity serves a different purpose: The anonymity of a kudos card serves to make it less awkward to appreciate someone, so it's really only important until the message is delivered. Delivering them anonymously effectively helps those who'd otherwise feel too shy to appreciate someone and further allows to share more emotional appreciations that would leave the sender exposed and vulnerable.

It's not like you're collecting anonymous feedback that can be very negative and which could have negative consequences for the sender if they'd be exposed. It's a slightly less dangerous situation as you're "only" sharing positive feedback to begin with. For those kind of situations, "Letters to the management" can be a valuable exercise, but then anonymity has to be preserved at all costs.

## Appreciation isn't binary

- Inflationary use of kudos drowns "valuable" kudos in "appreciative, but less personal ones"
- "Thank you for helping me move the table earlier today" vs. "Thanks for helping me overcome my imposter syndrome, your validation helps me survive in our industry"

"If you'd have only the one kudos card you really like, would that be better than having it among the other more trivial ones?"

## Metrics

- How appreciated does the average employee feel? (is this the optimization goal?)
  - Do a lot of trivial appreciations make up for one deeply personal one?
- "If you never give kudos cards and then someone gives you one, it's a special thing. Scarcity and all. But you have people who then don't feel appreciated"
  - Over- vs. undersaturation of appreciation
