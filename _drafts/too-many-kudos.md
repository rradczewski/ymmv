Kudos cards help you overcome the awkwardness of sharing appreciations. This makes them a really powerful ritual, but you still have to take the time and hand-write the card; something that may slip your mind if you are frequently out of the office.
I recently built a slackbot that prints them in the office for you, but I'm left wondering if this could lead to devaluing the heartfelt appreciation they're supposed to convey.
In order to understand why this could be an issue, we first need to understand why they're so powerful in the first place.

## Why is it awkward anyway?

I guess it's part of the human condition, that we're generally more likely to put someone down when they mess up, than to appreciate them when they stand with us and help us out. And I totally get it, a heartfelt appreciation makes you vulnerable – it's much easier to be cynical and detached.

When a team manages to create a space safe enough for showing this kind of vulnerability though, Kudos cards become an amazing catalyst for team-building. It's still a bit awkward to give someone a kudos, but with a proper ritual and a feigned sense of anonymity (more on that later), they create a space of compassion and empathy.

## Why they work

In my experience, the first reason kudos cards work so well is because they decouple your appreciation from the act of verbalizing it. It makes it easier to appreciate more, but also to give more heartfelt, personal praise to someone.

I'm not the first one to come up with a (semi-)digital version of kudos. There are websites, an abundance of slack bots, there's even HR tools that make them part of your evaluation process – and trust me, I have a strong opinion on that. They all fall short on one thing though: The effort it takes to hand-craft a kudos card.

A hand-written kudos card carries a personal note no digital tool can make up for. It means someone took the time to carefully write a letter of appreciation to you. Maybe they scribbled a bit, changed the wording, added a smiley or an abundance of odd exclamation marks to stress just how much they appreciated you. This all adds a personal note to an already very empathic act that emojis and gifs just can't live up to.

You might even recognize the handwriting or have a suspicion about who wrote it to you – and that's part of the magic and excitement!

## Another kind of "anonymity"

When we hear the word "anonymity", we think about the goal being that something can not be associated with you ever.

With kudos cards, anonymity serves a different purpose: The anonymity of a kudos card serves to make it less awkward to appreciate someone, so it's really only important until the message is delivered. Delivering them anonymously effectively helps those who'd otherwise feel too shy to appreciate someone and further allows to share more emotional appreciations that would leave the sender exposed and vulnerable. So yes, anonymity is important as an enabler, but not because confidentiality is the most important goal.

## Kudos as a commodity

- Inflationary use of kudos drowns "valuable" kudos in "appreciative, but less personal ones"
- "Thank you for helping me move the table earlier today" vs. "Thanks for helping me overcome my imposter syndrome, your validation helps me survive in our industry"

"If you'd have only the one kudos card you really like, would that be better than having it among the other more trivial ones?"

## Metrics

- How appreciated does the average employee feel? (is this the optimization goal?)
  - Do a lot of trivial appreciations make up for one deeply personal one?
- "If you never give kudos cards and then someone gives you one, it's a special thing. Scarcity and all. But you have people who then don't feel appreciated"
  - Over- vs. undersaturation of appreciation
