It's been a while since I wrote something, so I figured I will start again with something easy yet super helpful: Explain everything before telling people to move - otherwise, you might end up having to explain everything again ;)

Let's work with an example situation, where I want to introduce a new workshop format:

> "Now please get into groups of three and make sure to introduce yourself first!"
> "The task is to build the tallest lego tower with the pieces we will hand out in a minute"

Now I am sure a lot of folks will recognize this as something obvious right away, especially if you ever had to work in a classroom setting: Right after the first sentence, the first people will start forming groups, talking, gesticulating, generally not paying any attention to me but to their peers instead.

Now if I rephrase it in a way that has the "call to action" at the end, there's a slightly higher chance that more people will have paid attention to the objective.

> "The task will be to build the tallest lego tower possible with the pieces I have here." 
> "I will distribute them after you have formed groups of three."

This even leaves a gap for questions regarding the lego tower before you move forward with the group formation phase!

Albeit it being a tiny change in how I introduce formats, I still found that it made my workshops much less chaotic and more productive. Hope it helps you too!
