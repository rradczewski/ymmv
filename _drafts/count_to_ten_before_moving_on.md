title: "From the Toolbox: Count to 10 before moving on"
---
In a virtual meeting, you not only need to account for psychological, but also technical barriers that keep people from contributing to the conversation. Fix this by introducing some structure and by counting to 10.

### Context

You're speaking (or might even leading) a virtual meeting. You want to have a discussion, but attention span, A/V quality and the pace of the meeting keep people from contributing. A typical symptom is that only a few people lead a conversation while others doze off and leave the meeting being unsatisfied.

Your expectation of a meeting is that every participant leaves the meeting well informed and with the feeling that their voices have been heard.

### Reasoning

In a typical group discussion, power dynamics and authority already leave some people being more wary about contributing. As the one calling for a meeting, it is up to you to only invite people who need to be there in the first place and then to make sure that they feel invited to contribute to the discussion or to speak up if they have any questions.

In a virtual meeting, especially in setups where a group of people are sitting together at one location, working with a conference room setup and without individual headsets[^1], speaking up involves gestures like unmuting the microphone and carefully injecting yourself into the conversation.

But even worse, if technical issues affect the call (which is always the case), people might not perceive what you are saying and would like to highlight that and ask you to repeat something.

If the pace of the meeting does not allow for someone to speak up, the meeting will be very one-sided and you won't get everyone on the same page.

### Pattern

Whenever you ask a question and no one seems to speak up immediately, count to 10.

> Do you have any questions left about $YYY?  
> 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...0  
> Alright, then we'll continue with $ZZZ

But don't stop there. If someone spoke up the first time, once they finish, start counting to 10 again so you give everyone in the group the chance to speak up.

> Thanks $PERSON. Anyone else would like to add something?  
> 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...0  
> Alright, then we'll continue with $ZZZ

This might seem very awkward at first, but people will quickly notice that you're merely providing space for other participants to chime in.

Related to A/V issues, it helps tremendously to account for technical difficulties right from the start:

> Please tell me if the connection is bad. I'll happily repeat whatever I said so you can hear me. Feel free to interrupt me if you find yourself being distracted for any reason.

This will frame the meeting in a way that makes people feel welcome and encourages them to speak up should they have difficulties understanding you - be it technical issues or you failing to bring across your point ðŸ˜œ.

While I found this pattern to work really well in virtual meetings, *Embracing Awkward Silence* can be a powerful pattern in face-to-face meetings or workshops as well.
