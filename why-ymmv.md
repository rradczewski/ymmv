# The name of this blog, Your mileage may vary...

...means all of my experiences and observations happen in a particular context, in a setting with a couple of individuals and with specific methods I'm trying out.
I'm happy if my articles help or inspire you and I'm very interested in your feedback (see below). At the end of the day, I'm describing my [biased](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18?gi=4d491e9aedc9#.2n3okjow7), privileged experiences in all the companies I've worked for, or at least what I think I saw and interpreted. If I'm totally off, please tell me.

This is also why I'm doing it in the open. My [Drafts](https://github.com/rradczewski/ymmv/tree/master/_drafts) are open for you to see, as there are [Issues](https://github.com/rradczewski/ymmv/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) where you can leave me feedback. If you prefer a direct way, try [Mail](mailto:hello@craftswerk.io).
