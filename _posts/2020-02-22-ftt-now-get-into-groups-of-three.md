It’s been a while since I wrote something, so I figured I will start again with something easy yet super helpful: **Explain everything before telling people to move, otherwise, you might have to explain everything again.**

Let's work with an example situation, one where I want to introduce a new workshop format:

> "Now please get into groups of three and make sure to introduce yourself first!"  
> "The task is to build the tallest lego tower with the pieces we will hand out in a minute"

Now I am sure a lot of folks will recognize this as something obvious right away, especially if you ever had to work in a classroom setting: Right after the first sentence, the first people will start forming groups, talking, gesticulating – generally not paying any attention to me, but to their peers instead.

Whatever I said after the "call to action" will go completely unnoticed and I won't get a chance to repeat it until the dust has settled down again.

<hr/>

If I rephrase it in a way that has the "call to action" at the end though, suddenly there's a much higher chance that more people will have paid attention to the objective before moving to act.

> "The task will be to build the tallest lego tower possible with the pieces I have here."  
> "I will distribute them after you have formed groups of three."

This even leaves a gap for any questions regarding the lego tower before you move on to the group formation phase! 

Despite it being a tiny change in how I introduce formats, I still found that it made my workshops much less chaotic and more productive. Hope it helps you too!
